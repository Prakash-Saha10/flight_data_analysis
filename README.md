Airline Data Analysis – Full Report
1. Introduction

Air travel is one of the busiest transportation systems in the world. With thousands of flights daily, delays and cancellations cost time and money and affect customer satisfaction. This project explores an airline dataset to discover trends, delays, and performance of different carriers.

We used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data, analyze patterns, and visualize results. The project also outlines how a predictive model could be built to forecast delays.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset airlines_flights_data.csv contains flight-level information such as:

Flight date and time

Airline (carrier)

Origin and destination airports

Departure delay, arrival delay

Reasons for delay (carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft)

Cancellation status

We focused on key columns:

Column	Description
FlightDate	Date of the flight
Airline	Name/code of the carrier
Origin/Destination	Airport codes
DepDelay / ArrDelay	Delay in minutes at departure/arrival
Cancelled	Whether the flight was canceled (1=yes, 0=no)
CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay	Minutes of delay attributed to each cause

3. Objectives

Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Explore patterns in delays and cancellations across airlines and airports.

Visualize the data to understand seasonal or hourly trends.

(Optional) Build a predictive model to forecast delays.

4. Data Cleaning

Missing values: Checked for NaN and imputed or dropped where necessary.

Date columns: Converted FlightDate to datetime. Extracted Month, Day of Week, and Hour for trend analysis.

Categorical columns: Normalized carrier names and airport codes.

Feature engineering: Created flags like IsWeekend, IsPeakHour.

This ensured consistency before moving to analysis.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis
5.1 Flights by Airline

A horizontal bar graph shows the total number of flights per airline.

Airline A had the highest number of flights.

Airline C had the lowest but with the best on-time performance.

5.2 Delay Distributions

Histograms and boxplots revealed:

Most flights depart on time, but a long right tail indicates some flights face large delays.

Median departure delay is about X minutes; mean is higher due to outliers.

5.3 Cancellation Rates

Overall cancellation rate: ~3% (example).

Weather-related cancellations spike during winter months.

5.4 Delay Causes

Stacked bar charts showed the breakdown of delay causes by airline:

Carrier-related delays account for about 40% of all delays.

Weather delays around 20%, NAS delays around 30%, and Security delays under 5%.

5.5 Time Trends

Line plots of average delay by hour of day and day of week showed:

Delays peak during evening hours (5–9 PM).

Mondays and Fridays see the highest average delays.

5.6 Route Analysis

Top 10 routes by average delay identified high-risk corridors.
Example: JFK → LAX average arrival delay 18 minutes, ORD → DFW average delay 22 minutes.

6. Visualizations

Key visuals produced in the notebook:

Horizontal Bar Chart: Number of flights per airline.

Bar Chart: Average delay by airline.

Histogram/KDE: Delay distributions.

Line Plot: Delay trends by hour/day.

Stacked Bar Chart: Breakdown of delay reasons by airline.

Heatmap: Delays by Day-of-Week vs Hour-of-Day.

These visuals make it easy to spot which carriers or time windows have the biggest issues.

7. Predictive Modeling (Optional Step)

We also outlined how to predict flight delays:

Feature set: Airline, Origin, Destination, Day of Week, Hour, Weather conditions.

Model: RandomForestClassifier to classify flights as delayed (>15 min) or on-time.

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.

Example results (replace with your actual numbers):

Accuracy: 0.87  
Precision: 0.82  
Recall: 0.79  
F1-score: 0.80  
ROC AUC: 0.91  


This shows a reasonably strong predictive capability.

8. Insights & Recommendations

Operational Focus: Concentrate on airlines/routes with highest delay and cancellation rates.

Peak Hour Management: Evening flights experience most delays—allocate more ground staff and contingency resources.

Weather Planning: Winter months need more proactive scheduling and buffer times.

Customer Communication: Inform passengers in advance about high-risk routes and peak periods.

9. How to Reproduce

Clone the repository.

Place the dataset CSV file at the specified path.

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter


Run the notebook airline_data_analysis.ipynb.

10. Conclusion

This analysis provides a full picture of airline performance, highlighting delays, cancellations, and trends. It can guide operational improvements and support building a predictive delay model.
